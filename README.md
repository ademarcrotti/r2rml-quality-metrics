#R2RML Quality Metrics for Luzzu

This project provides a number of metrics available to assess the quality of R2RML mappings.

These metrics must be used together with the [Luzzu Framework](https://github.com/Luzzu/Framework/tree/V5) branch V5.

In order to assess R2RML mappings you need to build the project and add it to Luzzu together with its description, which is described in the file metrics.trig.
